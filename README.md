# PlaysTV Scraper
The repository consists of a command-line utility `playstv-scraper` that can be used to download all the videos from a PlaysTV userpage as they appear in the most recent archive.org's Wayback Machine snapshot. This can be useful to recover your lost videos after the 12/15/2019 Plays.tv's shutdown.
